### Key Components

#### Baby Name Generator

```tsx
// Key implementation details for the Baby Name Generator
const generateNames = (motherName: string, fatherName: string, options: NameOptions): string[] => {
  // Algorithm combines letters from both parents' names
  // Applies filters based on gender, length preferences
  // Returns array of unique generated names
};
```

#### Advanced Image Compressor

```tsx
// Key implementation details for the Advanced Image Compressor
const compressImage = async (file: File, options: CompressionOptions): Promise<CompressedImage> => {
  // Uses browser-image-compression library
  // Applies custom quality and size settings
  // Returns compressed image with statistics
};
```

#### Propeller Ads Integration

```tsx
// Service Worker Registration
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    .then(registration => {
      console.log('Propeller Ads SW registered:', registration.scope);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Propeller Ads SW registration failed:', error);
    });
}
```

## Monetization Strategy

### Ad Implementation

The website implements multiple ad types through Propeller Ads:

1. **Banner Ads**
   - Placed strategically throughout the site
   - Responsive sizing based on viewport
   - Non-intrusive placement to maintain user experience

2. **Native Ads**
   - Blend with content for better user acceptance
   - Placed in-feed and in-article
   - Styled to match site design

3. **Interstitial Ads**
   - Triggered at natural transition points
   - Limited frequency to avoid user frustration
   - Configurable through the Ad Settings page

### Revenue Optimization

To achieve the $1000 monthly revenue target:

1. **Strategic Ad Placement**
   - High-visibility areas without disrupting UX
   - Above-the-fold placements for key pages
   - Content-integrated placements for higher engagement

2. **Traffic Growth Initiatives**
   - SEO optimization for organic traffic
   - Content marketing strategy
   - Social media promotion

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Ad Analytics Dashboard for real-time tracking
   - A/B testing framework for optimization
   - Revenue projection modeling

### User Experience Balance

The monetization strategy balances revenue generation with user experience:

- Ads don't interfere with core tool functionality
- User-configurable ad preferences
- Performance optimization to minimize impact on page load times

## Deployment Process
